My first website using HTML, CSS

Based on a HTML and CSS tutorial by Web Dev Simplified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMT54MPz9oE

Description:
- Non-functional website focusing on layout and design elements 
- contains a css stylesheet and links to all other related html pages
- fonts imported from both online api's and locally stored fonts
- use of common classes, reducing some repetition, although can be reduced further


Improvements:
- use CSS Grid instead of grouping with div
- separation of CSS doc: too long to read, can be grouped on to separate sheets?
- learn JS to provide functionality
